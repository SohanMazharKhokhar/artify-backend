# Artify Backend â€“ Node.js API

A Final Year Project of **Bachelor's of Computer Sciences** based on a **Customized/Personalized Products E-commerce Platform**. This repository contains the backend implementation of the application using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The mobile application and frontend website components are developed by a fellow colleague.

## Project Summary

**Artify** is a platform that enables users to customize products such as mugs, t-shirts, and frames. It facilitates interactions between customers and manufacturers through a multi-manufacturer bidding system. The backend provides robust APIs for user authentication, product management, cart functionality, and secure order processing. 

This backend was developed as part of a final year project to demonstrate full-stack development, API security, database integration, and scalable design principles.
